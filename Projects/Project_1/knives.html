    <p><strong>When cooking one of the most versatile and important tools in a chefs belt is the knife</strong> . Cooking knives come in all shapes and sizes but today we will only be focusing in on 3 main types. We will discuss the basic Chef knife, the Pairing Knife, and the serrated or Bread knife. We will discuss the applications in which you would use each of these knives, the specific care when caring for these and what they look like.

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">1. Chef Knife</h3>
    <img src="images/ChefKnife1.jpg" alt="images/ChefKnife1.jpg">
    <p style="float: right;">The Chefs knife is one of the most universal knives you will have in your kit. These knives are good for almost any scenario and are key to leveling up as a chef or home cook. Chef knives tend to come in 6 inch and 8 inch versions. 8 inch being the most common out there. These knives can also come in a wide range of materials from Hammered steal, to Stainless steal to carbon. Choosing between these three really comes down to personal preference, however a basic stainless steal is a great starting point.

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Pairing Knife</h3>
    <img src="image/ParingKnive2.webp" alt="Image 2">
    <p style="float: right;">Pairing knives are not the most important in your kit and some could argue you dont really need a pairing knife as a chef knife can do the same thing. Abasically a pairing knife is used to peel things like in the picture to the left, make fine cuts or cut smaller fruits. Its helpful to have around but over all is not as important to have as the other two knives mentioned here.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Bread / Serrated Knife</h3>
    <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
    <p style="float: right;">Serrated Knives are mainly used to either cut bread or to cut smooth skinned vegetables' or meats. The serration allows you to cut through thicker foods and pierce the skin of tomatoes. Serrated knives can come in smaller 3-4 inch sizes while bread knives tend to be 10 - 11 Inches in length. One important aspect to these knives is that they cannot be hand sharpened, and once they become dull you will need to replace them. For these knives you don’t need supper expensive ones.</p>
