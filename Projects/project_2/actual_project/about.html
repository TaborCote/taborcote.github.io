        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My experience is 20 years in the service/hospitality industry, 15 years in specific kava and tea lounge service, and six years of business ownership. I am thankful for plenty of lessons, failures, and successes! I am also a single mother of a great vibrant human who is 10 years old.</p>

        Tea Lounge Consultation
      </h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            I’d love to offer my knowledge, wisdom, and encouragement of running a small non-alcohol tea lounge business. This offer is extended to Indigenous entrepreneurs whose ancestry is of the South Pacific Islands, Pacific Northwest, and/or South American tribes. It is because of these ancestors that our Nalu hub is able to exist. </p>
  
          <p>
            Thankful I am for all the nourishment from the drinks of Kava-Kava, Cacao, and the cradle of being located here on the Multnomah, Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, Clackamas, Cowlitz, Cascades, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz peoples lands. This offering is at the moment the best way I can give back. Potentially such consultations could amount to well over $10,000 in regular circumstances where such services are exchanged for money-flow. It’s such a honor to offer this. I hope some driven and passionate humans engage!</p>
      <h3>
        Prerequisites:
      </h3>
        <p>
        Those seeking this service will be asked to compose a letter explaining who they are, their passions, goals, and current standing in relationship to such. Space is limited but I can create a waitlist if time allows.

            If you can give time, give. if you can give money, give. If you can give food, give.

          <p>
            Nalu is so thankful to have donated to these wonderful communities. We've also raised money for friends who patron Nalu often but won't list them here to honor their privacy.</p>

  <h2 class="landaknowledgement">Land Acknowledgment</h2>
  <p>We honor and thank the Polynesians, Hawaiians, Micronesians, and Asian-Pacific Islanders, for protecting the islands, the animals, and the South Pacific Oceans. Through their perseverance to survive past and modern day colonization, the history and wisdom of the ancient ways are maintained.

  </p>

  <p>I can support by embodying change. Imbuing reverence and respect can take the form of learning Pacific Islander history, their culture, their wisdom. Humility and kindness when visiting the Islands are also ways to honor those indigenous to these regions. All too often people take vacations without reverence or respect for the places they visit. Please educate, listen, and change accordingly so that we might create a better World.</p>
